### Windows 10 Desktop Recreation by Kevgmd

- This project is an personal attempt of recreating the Microsoft Windows 10 desktop perfectly, made just for fun and to improve my proficiency at the programming languages used in the project, and notice that the desktop it's non functional and only has the dark mode available, so it is kind of a fake Windows 10.

- This is my first little project while learning HTML and CSS, so i took almost 1 month to complete it (and i polished some things after), since this is my first project, i hope this isn't just a goofy code that somehow managed to work properly.

- ~~I Had a big help from Bootstrap in the development.~~ <br>I completely remade the code, making it shorter and without Bootstrap.

- ~~The live clock and the date isn't working for now, someday i'll make it work (maybe).~~ <br> The time and date live clock is done and its completely functional now!

- You can prank someone by pretending to be the Windows 10!
