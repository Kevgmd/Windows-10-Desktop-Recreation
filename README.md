### Windows 10 Desktop Recreation by Kevgmd

- This project is an attempt of recreating the Microsoft Windows 10 desktop perfectly (notice that the desktop it's non functional and only the dark mode is available).

- And notice that this is my first little project while learning HTML and CSS, and i took almost 1 month to complete it, that's because i was still learning during the process, so i hope my project isn't just a goofy code that somehow managed to work properly. 

- I Had a big help from Bootstrap in the development.

- The live clock isn't working for now, someday i will fix it (maybe).
