### Windows 10 Desktop Recreation by Kevgmd

- This project is an attempt of recreating the Microsoft Windows 10 desktop perfectly (currently it have only the dark mode).

- Notice that this is my first little project while learning HTML and CSS, and i took almost 1 month to complete it, that's because i was still learning during the process.

- I Had a big help from Bootstrap in the development.

- The live clock isn't working for now, someday i will fix it (maybe).
